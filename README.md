## CHAT APP ##

This Chat App is developed using React Native and Expo. The data will be stored in Google's Firestore. 
I will be using the Gifted Chat React Native library. The Chat App will allow users to send not only text messages, but also some containing images. They will also be able to share their location with others.
React Native is a React framework for building Android and iOS apps that requires only one codebase instead of multiple for Android (Java/Kotlin) or iOS apps (Swift).

Features (so far):
- User can navigate between Home Screen and Chat Screen
- User can choose a background color for their chat screen from a selection of colors
